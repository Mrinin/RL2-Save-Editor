	<b>How it works:</b>
	Go to your save file at C:\Users\(yourname)\AppData\LocalLow\Cellar Door Games\Rogue Legacy 2\Saves\Steam\(your steam profile ID)\(your profile)\ and upload the file named "Player.rc2dat"
	After that, you can edit your class, traits, relics, weapons, talents and spell.
	All weapons, talents and spell share the same item pool, meaning you can have character with 3 weapons, talents or spells!
	(This save file also stores things like bosses defeated and currency obtained, so I recommend uploading a new file for every heir.)

	If you'd like to edit save files manually, here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18yQwfGgd-gDP0wR5ElrWy9wm6QJhGoyd1UkKkNPIn94/edit">guide</a> I wrote.
